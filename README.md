🌱 Carbon Footprint Prediction Using Feature Engineering and Machine Learning
📘 Introduction
This project focuses on predicting household carbon footprints using a combination of energy consumption, lifestyle habits, dietary preferences, and demographic information. The goal is to provide insights into how various factors—like electricity usage, household size, diet type, and sustainable practices—impact an individual's or family's carbon emissions.

By engineering meaningful features and applying machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest), this project aims to:

Estimate the monthly carbon footprint of households.

Highlight key contributing factors to high emissions.

Empower users with data-driven recommendations for reducing environmental impact.

🧠 Features Engineered
The following features are computed to enrich the dataset before model training:

Energy Metrics:

natural_gas_kWh_per_month

total_energy

energy_per_person

energy_per_sqft

Water and Transport:

water_usage_per_person

vehicle_miles_per_person

Food Consumption:

meat_consumption_kg_per_person

diet_impact (vegan, vegetarian, omnivore)

Sustainability Behavior:

sustainability_score (based on 5 binary eco-friendly habits)

carbon_intensity (energy vs sustainability ratio)

Socioeconomic:

income_per_sqft (optional, if income data is available)
