## 🌍 Carbon Footprint Prediction

### 📘 Introduction

This project predicts household **carbon footprints** using a mix of data related to energy usage, transportation, diet, water consumption, and sustainable living practices. The goal is to estimate environmental impact and promote eco-conscious decisions by modeling household behavior with machine learning.

By applying feature engineering and using predictive algorithms like XGBoost, the model identifies key emission drivers and generates accurate footprint estimates.

## 🧠 Features Engineered

We engineer a variety of features to enhance model performance and interpretability:

### 🔌 Energy Usage
- `natural_gas_kWh_per_month`: Natural gas converted from therms to kWh.
- `total_energy`: Total energy from electricity and natural gas.
- `energy_per_person`: Total energy normalized by household size.
- `energy_per_sqft`: Energy usage normalized by household area.

### 🚿 Water & Transport
- `water_usage_per_person`: Daily water usage per person.
- `vehicle_miles_per_person`: Monthly vehicle miles traveled per person.

### 🍽️ Diet & Lifestyle
- `meat_consumption_kg_per_person`: Weekly meat consumption per individual.
- `diet_impact`: Encoded diet score (vegan = 1, omnivore = 3).
- `sustainability_score`: Count of eco-friendly actions (e.g., recycling, composting).
- `carbon_intensity`: Energy usage relative to sustainability practices.

### 💰 Socioeconomic (Optional)
- `income_per_sqft`: Monthly income divided by house area.
